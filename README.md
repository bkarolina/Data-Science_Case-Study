# Data-Science_Case-Study
Put all together that I learn about ML and learn even more.

I decided to do a project here on Github adn try to demonstrate what I have/will have learned from Data Science so far.

## Problem
The aim of this project is simple - webscrape website [dpreview](https://www.dpreview.com/) to look for camera models, their prices, quick specs. Then the data read to csv file, do cleaning and a preparation of the data. And finally, to do some machine learning! Find out which features are more important and be able to predict prices of other models of cameras according their quick specs.
##### Note: Keep in mind, this project is purely for studying purposes and if you want to scrap any webpage, firstly check for their terms and condition regerding it. #####

Problem is quite easy and naive. However, the aim of this mini project is to go through the whole process, and to help me to grasp all together and in the end to feel joy and satisfaction :-) 

Let's the journey begins!

_(this will be updated as I move forward with the project)_
