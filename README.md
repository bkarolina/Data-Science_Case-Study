# Data-Science_Case-Study
Put all together that I learn about ML and learn even more.

I decided to do a project here on Github adn try to demonstrate what I have/will have learned from Data Science so far.

## Problem
Firstly, I need to scrape webpage to get data, transofr data to desirable format and then I can do data cleaning, feature selection/engineering, modelling and finally predicting. Problem is quite easy and naive. However, the aim of this mini project is to go through the whole process, and to help me to grasp all together and in the end to feel joy and satisfaction :-) 

Let's the journey begins!

_(this will be updated as I move forward with the project)_
